Stock Market Data Analysis

Stock tickers were evaluated to find the following:
  - Yearly price change for each ticker (close price - open price), from the day the ticker opened to the last day of the year.  
    (For most tickers, the day the ticker opened was January 1.)
  - Percent change for each ticker (close price - open price)/open price)
  - Total Stock Volume traded for that ticker for the year.

Yearly Percent Changes were highlighted as follows: red for negative yearly percent change; green for positive yearly percent change.
No highlighting was applied for zero percent change.   

Select results of the analysis are presented as image snips of the first page of results for each year, with filenames:
