Stock Market Data Analysis

Stock tickers were evaluated to find the following:
  - Yearly price change for each ticker (close price - open price), from the day the ticker opened to the last day of the year.  
    (For most tickers, the day the ticker opened was January 1.)
  - Percent change for each ticker (close price - open price)/open price)
  - Total Stock Volume traded for that ticker for the year.

Yearly Percent Changes were highlighted as follows: red for negative yearly percent change; green for positive yearly percent change.
No highlighting was applied for zero percent change.
